# SlideOutNavigation

This tutorial will show you how to build a slide-out navigation panel, which is a popular alternative to using a UINavigationController or a UITabBarController that allows users to slide content on or off screen.

The slide-out navigation panel design pattern lets developers add permanent navigation to their apps without taking up valuable screen real estate. The user can choose to reveal the navigation at any time, while still seeing their current context.

In this tutorial youâ€™ll take a less-is-more approach so you can apply the slide-out navigation panel technique to your own applications with relative ease
